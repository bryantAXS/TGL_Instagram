# TGL Instagram API

## This module is not ready to be relased yet, I should have it finalized in the next day or so and will upload it to Devot-ee.  Feel free to test if you would like, however it should not be considered production worthy.

This is an ExpressionEngine 2 module for interacting with the Instagram API.  Currently, the module only retrieves information from the authenticated user's feed and a specified user's feed.  The module has a CP backend, which directs the user through the oAuth process.
